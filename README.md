# 🎙️ Communication Score Analyzer

A real-time web application that evaluates your communication skills by analyzing **audio and video features simultaneously**. This project uses a **low-level feature fusion model**, combining insights from **facial expressions**, **speech sentiment**, and **grammar** — all in real-time.

It’s built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **OpenCV**, without relying on transformer-based models, making it lightweight and easy to run locally.
