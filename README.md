# AI-Based Communication Skills Scoring System
# This project builds a real-time AI system that evaluates a user's communication skills based on a 2-minute spoken input. It analyzes both verbal (grammar, clarity, emotion) and non-verbal (tone, facial expressions, gestures) cues to assign a score using multimodal machine learning.
